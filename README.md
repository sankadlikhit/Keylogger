INTRODUCTION : 


A program or Hardware device  that captures every key impression on the system.
Some uses of keyloggers could be considered ethical or appropriate in varying degrees. Keylogger recorders may also be used by:

1.	Employers to observe employees' computer activities;
2.	Parents to supervise their children's internet usage;
3.	Device owners to track possible unauthorized activity on their devices; or
4.	Law enforcement agencies to analyze incidents involving computer use.

Types of keyloggers

1.	A hardware-based keylogger is a small device that serves as a connector between the keyboard and the computer. The device is designed to resemble an ordinary keyboard PS/2 connector, part of the computer cabling or a USB adaptor, making it relatively easy for someone who wants to monitor a user's behavior to hide the device.

2.	A keylogging software program does not require physical access to the user's computer for installation. It can be purposefully downloaded by someone who wants to monitor activity on a particular computer, or it can be malware downloaded unwittingly and executed as part of a rootkit or remote administration Trojan (RAT). The rootkit can launch and operate stealthily to evade manual detection or antivirus scans.



BRIEF HISTORY : 


●	The first keyloggers were used by the Soviet Union in the 1970s to monitor IBM electric typewriters used at embassies based in Moscow. They would record what was typed and send the information back to Soviet intelligence via radio signals.

●	Keylogging predates the era of personal computers, with hardware-based keyloggers being used in typewriters as early as the 1970s. For example Russian spies found a way to bug IBM Selectric typewriters used by US diplomats, transmitting the keystrokes via radio frequency.

●	The most publicized case was the FBI's use of a keylogger in 1999 to gather evidence against Nicodemo Scarfo Jr., a reputed Cosa Nostra mobster. The FBI was investigating Scarfo for charges involving gambling and loan-sharking, but was having troubles due to Scarfo's use of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), a popular encryption program that scrambles computer files so that they cannot be opened without a password. To gain access to those files, FBI agents secured a search warrant in January 1999 against Scarfo and installed a software keylogger on Scarfo's computer. Using this keylogger, the FBI was able to determine Scarfo's PGP password, allowing them to view Scarfo's encrypted files. These files contributed to the evidence required to indict Scarfo in June 2000.

●	In early 2005 the London police prevented a serious attempt to steal banking data. After attacking a banking system, the cyber criminals had planned to steal $423 million from Sumitomo Mitsui’s London-based offices. The main component of the Trojan used, which was created by the 32-year-old Yeron Bolondi, was a keylogger that allowed the criminals to track all the keystrokes entered when victims used the bank’s client interface.




HOW DOES IT WORKS : 

●	Keystrokes are how you “speak” to your computers. Each keystroke transmits a signal that tells your computer programs what you want them to do.

●	These commands may include:

○	Length of the keypress
○	Time of keypress
○	Velocity of keypress
○	Name of the key used

●	When logged, all this information is like listening to a private conversation. You believe you’re only “talking” with your device, but another person listened and wrote down everything you said. With our increasingly digital lives, we share a lot of highly sensitive information on our devices.

●	User behaviors and private data can easily be accessed from logged keystrokes. Everything from online banking access to social security numbers is entered into computers. Social media, email, websites visited, and even text messages sent can all be highly revealing.

TYPES OF KEYLOGGERS :

1) Form Grabbing

Form grabbing is a type of keylogger that’s specifically designed to record data entered into web forms. Web forms are elements on websites that allow visitors to enter data. Some of them are used for logins, whereas others are used for visitor comments. Regardless, a form-grabbing keylogger can see what you enter into these forms. Form-grabbing keyloggers are typically deployed on websites rather than the hosts’ computers.

2) JavaScript

Different keyloggers use different technologies to record keystrokes. JavaScript keyloggers are characterized by the use of JavaScript. They are written in JavaScript code, which is injected into websites and web pages. Once injected, a JavaScript keylogger will run scripts to record the keystrokes of the website’s or page’s visitors.

3) Memory Injection

Another common type of keylogger is memory injection. Memory-injection keyloggers are designed to modify the memory tables in a user’s web browser. It’s one of the more technical types of keyloggers. By modifying the memory tables, an attacker can bypass the web browser’s safeguards to eavesdrop on the user’s keyloggers.

4) API

There are also Application Programming Interface (API) keyloggers. API keyloggers are characterized by the use of an API. They run inside of applications where they are able to record keystrokes. Each time you press a key — or when you release your finger from a key — an event is recorded in the API keylogger.

5) Hardware

While most keyloggers are software based, some of them are hardware based. Hardware-based keyloggers typically consist of dongles. These dongles may be connected to a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port. Once connected, hardware-based keyloggers will run automatically in the background of the user’s computer while recording his or her keystrokes.


ADVANTAGES & LIMITATIONS OF KEYLOGGERS  :


Advantages :- 
1.	In the office, having a keylogger installed allows you to check on your employees and see how much time they actually spend working and how much time they spend doing stuff that’s not office-related. This’ll prevent employees from getting paid just to browse Facebook.
2.	At home, having keylogging software installed allows you to monitor your children’s activities and guide them accordingly. You can see whether or not they’ve really been working on that school project or they’ve simply been playing games or chatting with their friends. You can also protect your children from kidnappers or pedophiles since you can easily check whoever your children have been talking to online.
3.	Having keylogging software installed to spy on other peoples’ activity is usually an eye-opening experience, but surprisingly, some people have actually discovered that using the software on themselves allows them to stay productive. Since the first step to being productive is knowing how long it takes you to finish a task, installing the keylogging software will accurately record the times when you’re actually working and the times when you were just trying to convince yourself that you’re working.

Limitations :-
1.	In the office, state law would probably require you to inform your employees about the installation of keylogging software on the computers they’re using. The decision to install keylogging software is almost always negatively received by employees and may cause them to be resentful with their employers. Sneaky employees may also find ways to bypass keylogging software using anti-keyloggers or onscreen keyboards.
2.	At home, technologically adept children may have no problem bypassing the keyloggers, either by using a touchscreen gadget or simply disabling the software through some sly hack.
3.	Some of the advanced Antivirus can now detect the keyloggers very quickly.
4.	Windows Security is also now capable of detecting any keylogger or virus threats to the windows user.
 


 
APPLICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF KEYLOGGER :

1.	It takes a minute to install this software/hardware in the victim’s system, from the next second onwards the attacker will get every activity going on in the victim computer.
2.	Keyloggers can be written in Python , C , C++ or Bash language.
3.	Each and every activity happening in the victim’s system with screenshots will be recorded. This activity will be saved in the victim’s system or it can be mailed to the attacker email or can be uploaded to the FTP server. Wondered? Let’s see how attackers do this along with protection techniques.
4.	Keylogging highlight of spy applications is adept at recording each and every keystroke made by utilizing a console, regardless of whether it is an on-screen console.
5.	It likewise takes a screen capture of the screen when the client is composing (Usually this screen capture is taken when a catch on the mouse is clicked).
6.	It works watchfully, escapes the client’s view, for example, the focus on the client could never discover that all his keystrokes are being recorded.
7.	Keyloggers recorder can record writings, email, and any information you compose at whatever point using your support.
8.	The log record made by the keyloggers would then have the option to be sent to a predefined gatherer.
9.	Some keyloggers tasks will likewise record any email that tends to your use and Web website URLs you visit.
10.	This keylogger sends a keystroke to a specific discord server.
11.	This keylogger is able to successfully bypass the windows security.
